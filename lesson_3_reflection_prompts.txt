When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when we need to use version control and commit our changes .

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We need to update our local directory with the new changes .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    W e use fork when we want to modify the projects we dont have permission on the creators repository.
since the creater can grant access to the files and allowed to be forked we can clone the files to our local computers
and push the chnges we commit . branches are a part of the project that support each other in order to function.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    we can recall at any time to see the previous version in case we have encountered a bug on our way to updating our
projects.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    with out git or github it will be difficult to collaberate with others . I would think of using google drive
updating and sharing each change we want to use but still it will take a long process.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
